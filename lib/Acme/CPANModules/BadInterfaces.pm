our $LIST = {
    summary => 'Modules with bad interfaces',
    description => <<'_',

This is my subjective list of modules that I think need to be highlighted as
examples of those that have {bad,awful,kludgy} interface (API), making them
unnecessarily inconvenient to use. Modules that leave you in a bad taste or even
makes you hate Perl and programming because of them.
